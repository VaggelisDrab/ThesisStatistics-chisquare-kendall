# ThesisStatistics-chisquare-kendall
My thesis explored the perspectives of art university students and IT students worldwide regarding AI-generated art, at the time new ai art-tools with really impressive results came out. It examined their opinions on AI art, the tools used to create it, and its potential impact on the future in the creative field. 

Around 200+ forms where submited, keeping 50/50 balance between art students and it students for better results.  Chi-square tests are used to assess the relationship between categorical variables and Kendall's correlation tests measure the strength of association between ordinal or continuous variables. The p-value is generated in both tests to determine statistical significance
